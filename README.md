# Advance_Wars_Rush
My final project for my Computer Organization course which is a single-player 2D grid game based on Nintendo's Advance Wars franchise. Programmed in both C and MIPS; the objective is to remove all stationary targets in as few moves as possible. MIPS program contains 1000+ lines of code and incorporates nested subroutines, 2D array traversal, floating-point registers, sound, and the stack.
