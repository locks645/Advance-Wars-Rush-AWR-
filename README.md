# Advance_Wars_Rush
My final project for my Computer Organization course which is a single-player grid-based game inspired by Nintendoâ€™s Advance Wars franchise. The game is programmed in C and MIPS with the objective being to remove all stationary targets in as few moves as possible. The MIPS file contains 1000+ lines of code and incorporates nested subroutines, 2D array traversal, floating-point registers, sound, and the stack.
